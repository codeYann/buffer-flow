# Producer-Consumer Problem

This repository contains a Java implementation of the Producer-Consumer problem using multithreading. The Producer-Consumer problem is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem. The producer generates data and stores it in a shared buffer, and the consumer takes the data from the buffer for processing. The challenge is to ensure that the producer does not try to add data into a full buffer and the consumer does not try to remove data from an empty buffer.
